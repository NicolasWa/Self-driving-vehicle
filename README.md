# Self-driving-vehicle
First year project "BACAR" (2017): prototyping a self-driving vehicle using a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino nano, and sensors (including a camera)

This first year project consisted in prototyping a small self-driving vehicle using:
-	A Raspberry Pi to process the input data coming from a camera (computer vision), and to act as the decision centre (“the head”, written in Python).
-	An Arduino nano to process the emergency sensor’s input, as well as to convert the orders coming from the Raspberry Pi into electrical signals to the motors (“the body”)

The group achieved the following goals for the self-driving vehicle:
-	Make the vehicle follow a curved or straight road 
-	Make the vehicle cross or turn at an intersection (random choice if no constraints)
-	Make the vehicle recognize the street signs  (stop, turn left, turn right, continue straight ahead) and act accordingly at the next intersection
